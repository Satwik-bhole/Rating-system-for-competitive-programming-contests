# Rating-system-for-competitive-programming-contests

The weightage of each constest and its difficulty were given as a csv file and the details of the 50 participants were given in another csv file(which event which participant took part in etc)

Using appropriate and fair rating update formula and penalties for contests missed, created a efficient and fair rating update system for contests
