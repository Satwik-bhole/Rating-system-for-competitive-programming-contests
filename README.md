# Rating-system-for-competitive-programming-contests

The weightage of each constest and its difficulty were given as a csv(event_weights.csv) file and the details of the 50 participants were given in another csv(Participant_details.csv) file(which event which participant took part in etc)

Using appropriate and fair rating update formula and penalties for contests missed, created a efficient and fair rating update system for contests
